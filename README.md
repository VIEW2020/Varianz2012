# VARIANZ 2012

As part of VIEW's drive toward machine learning in CVD risk prediction, the team began a research collaboration with Sebastiano Barbieri 
and Louisa Jorm from the University of New South Wales in December 2019. The initial project aim to establish baseline survival models 
using a 2012 VARIANZ population. Suneela Mehta from VIEW will update the 2006 VARIANZ policy equation using the prior statistical learning 
method, whereas Sebastiano will aim to create a survival model using a deep learning method. Further, Sebastiano aims to explore additional 
risk factors and predictors as part of a deep learning pipeline, and determine the added effects of prior unknown variables.
